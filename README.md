This project has been abandoned and all core content has been moved to https://github.com/openblockcc/external-resources-v2. However, since this repository is related to the online update function of the previous version of openblock desktop v2.2.x and link v1.0.0, this repository will not be deleted, but it will no longer be maintained and updated. Please upgrade your software to the latest version as soon as possible to use external-resources-v2 resources.
